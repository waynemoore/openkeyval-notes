Description
===========
A very basic note taking app using OpenKeyval (http://openkeyval.org/) 
as a storage backend.

This was just a quick hack to demonstrate how you could drop a few
files into dropbox and have a dynamic site served from a dropbox public
URL.

Usage
=====
Open up the main javascript file and change the "MAIN_KEY" value to something
only you know, e.g. "foo-9831724jksdf".

Note, this was only tested in Chrome.

WARNING
=======
This is very insecure.  Anyone who knows the value of MAIN_KEY can easily
alter your data and potentially inject code into your page.
